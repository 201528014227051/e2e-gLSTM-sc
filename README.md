This repository includes the code for end-to-end gLSTM and sentence-conditional semantic attention, as appeared in paper "Image Caption Generation with Text-Conditional Semantic Attention". The implementation is based on Neuraltalk2 (https://github.com/karpathy/neuraltalk2). Please follow the instructions on Neuraltalk2 to run the code.
